# Vector Library Performance Test
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE.txt)

The purpose of this performance test was to review several methods/libraries
available for vector/matrix math operations.

+ [Apache commons-math](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/apidocs/org/apache/commons/math3/geometry/euclidean/threed/Vector3D.html)
+ [Pythagoras Library](https://github.com/samskivert/pythagoras)
+ [Yeppp! Library](http://www.yeppp.info/)
+ LWJGL OpenCL (TODO)

Vector classes using double precision floating point numbers were used. Where
classes were missing, a plain java alternative was implemented.

## Performance Test Results


|     Benchmark     | Samples | Score |  Error  | units |
|-------------------|---------|-------|---------|-------|
| testApacheCommons |      20 | 1.916 | ± 0.428 | ops/s |
| testPythagoras    |      20 | 7.572 | ± 0.355 | ops/s |
| testYepp          |      20 | 0.205 | ± 0.001 | ops/s |


## Review of Libraries
### Apache commons-math

+ \+ lots of other classes we may want to use
+ \- bloated
+ \~ performance is okay but not the best.

### Pythagoras
The Pythagoras has the best performance. It is also small

+ \+ very small
+ \+ performance
+ \- no unit tests for double class

### Yeppp!
Yeppp doesn't have the best performance for our application, and we'd have alter
the design to cater for performance to get any kind of benefit.

+ \+ small
+ \+ popular
+ \- poor performance in java and for our application


[c++ - Performance with Yeppp! is slower than native implementation - Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26504111/performance-with-yeppp-is-slower-than-native-implementation)
> Yeppp! is optimized for processing arrays of 100+ elements.
> It is not efficient on small arrays (like length-3 array in your example)
> due to limited ability to use SIMD and overheads of function call, dynamic
> dispatching, and parameter checks.
